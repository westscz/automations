# AutomateBoringStuff

Here is more detailed information about scripts I have written.
I create these little programs as experiments to play with the language, or to solve problems for myself.

- [apple_photo_timestamper](apple_photo_timestamper.py) - Add timestamp to photos from iPhone
- [chrome_pocket.py](chrome_pocket.py) - Get saved articles from pocket and move them to folder in chrome bookmarks
- [dcim](dcim.py) - Move files from photocamera to proper timestamped directories
- [find_rss_feed.py](find_rss_feed.py) - For RSS_URLS_list find RSS urls and generate opml.xml file
- [filename_normalizer](filename_normalizer.py) - Normalize file naming to work on OSX/UNIX/WIN
- [image_scrapper](image_scrapper.py) - Scrap images from deviantart
- [instagram_saved.py](instagram_saved.py) - Download all saved photos from instagram account
- [pymd](pymd) - POC to create markdown files from python files.

Warning: No guarantee that any of this stuff works.
